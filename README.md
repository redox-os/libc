## Building the toolchain and libc

Run `./libc.sh` to build the gcc toolchain and newlib libc implementation.

## Building ports

To build a port, enter the ports directory with `cd ports`. Choose a port to build, such as lua, keeping in mind the fact that many of the ports due not work yet. You can then run `./lua.sh add` to build the port. You can then copy the binary `../build/sysroot/usr/bin/lua` to Redox's filesystem.
